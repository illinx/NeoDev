Version 0.2 updates:
====================

Introduced sprite pools, check documentation.
Introduced a new sprite framing tool.


Tools related
-------------

- Fixed various glitches/craches/file locks across tools.
- Buildchar: tool now requires to specify input xml file. Added config options, see doc.
             This allow to alleviate char processing time by splitting assets into multiple files.
- Buildchar: it is now possible to mix auto4 and auto8 tiles on the same file.
- Buildchar: when processing sprites, data not used in frames is now ignored.


Misc code related
-----------------

- Switched draw commands tables addressing mode (from index to pointer).
  This changes nothing except if you made custom code to write in these tables.
- Added draw buffers usage meter (dip 2-3).
- Squeezed out some more CPU cycles here and there.
- Renamed a few element for consistency:
	wait_vblank()	=>	waitVBlank()
	Scroller	=>	scroller
	Picture		=>	picture
- Revamped timer interrupt code:
	* Runs faster
	* Should now retain effect on dropped frames.
	* Now uses the USP register, no more OS writing for you.
	* Changed data format for rasters info, check doc.
	* Removed the default raster data tables, allocate your own tables if you use timer interrupt.
	* Can now updates two values per IRQ trigger.
