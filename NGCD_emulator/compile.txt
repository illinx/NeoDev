See your relevant section for how to compile NeoCD/SDL

These instructions are a quick guide to building neocd/sdl and in no way
are guaranteed to be very accurate or helpful.

Sorry for the poor documentation, but if you have any experience of compiling 
programs in a gnu environment then I hope you should be able to follow this well
enough to build.

Windows
=======
You will require

mingw  (www.mingw.org)
msys   (www.mingw.org)
SDL development libraries for mingw  (www.libsdl.org)
nasm (nasm.sourceforge.net)


Extract the Neocd/SDL sources somewhere

Install msys and mingw.
Copy nasmw.exe into one of the bin directories in the msys/mingw directory.

Unpack the SDL development library follow the installation instructions for it.

change directory to the neocd/sdl sources

type:
make mingw

and neocd should build





Linux
=====
SDL source  (www.libsdl.org)
nasm (nasm.sourceforge.net)

Install nasm.

To get the cd audio to work I have had to modify SDL slightly, so you will have
to rebuild it from source.  Instructions for that should be found in the SDL
distribution.

The change is in <SDL dir>/src/cdrom/linux/SDL_syscdrom.c
change line 124 to:
	cdfd = open(drive, (O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK), 0);
	
change line 385 to:
	return(open(SDL_cdlist[drive], (O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK), 0));
	
build and install the SDL library.

cd to neocd/sdl source directory and type "make linux"

If everything went ok you should have a new neocd executable.
